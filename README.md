# Lost_Circulation
Lost circulation is a major problem encountered in the drilling process and is defined as the unwanted loss of the whole or a portion of drilling mud into a formation. 
This occurrence can lead to some severe problems, including pipe stuck, formation damage, blowout, and wellbore instability, leading to an increase in time and cost of the operation.
